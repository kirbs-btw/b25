## General 
Training a standard word embedding model involves exposing it to a large corpus of sentences, allowing it to learn the semantic relationships between words by analyzing how they co-occur within sentence structures. This process relies on the distributional hypothesis, which suggests that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.

The approach in question extends this concept by drawing an analogy between sentences as collections of words and playlists as collections of songs. To construct a model for playlists, one could initially consider the song titles as the equivalent of words and the playlists as analogous to sentences. However, this direct mapping poses challenges when utilizing algorithms designed for natural language processing.

Many word embedding algorithms, such as Word2Vec, focus on local context windowsâ€”capturing the relationships between a word and its immediate neighbors. This assumption of locality doesn't directly translate to playlists, where the relationship between songs isn't necessarily dependent on their proximity or order within the playlist. Hence, adapting such algorithms for playlist modeling requires addressing the contextual difference between word co-occurrence and song co-inclusion in playlists. 

## Data
The base dataset is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/spotify-playlists)

## Models
## Model Validation

The dataset is divided into two sets: training and testing, to mitigate overfitting. The model evaluation involves selecting a song from a playlist and allowing the model to predict the next song. If the predicted song is present in the same playlist, the model is marked as correct. Currently, the model is not evaluated on its ability to understand the context or sequence of songs, which represents a potential future testing phase. In essence, the model receives one song as input and suggests the next best matching song based on its learned associations.

### General Observations and Future Steps
- **Need for Larger Test Sets**: All models should be tested against a much larger set of playlists, as testing on only 250 playlists may not provide sufficient variability and insight into model performance. Thats about 10.000 songs
- **Accuracy Potential**: It remains to be seen how high the accuracy can reach with these approaches, but further experimentation and optimization are necessary.

## Training Algorithms
### CBOW (Continuous-Bag-of-Words)

The Continuous-Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model aims to predict a target word, known as the *center word*, based on a given context of surrounding words. This model operates under the distributional hypothesis, which suggests that words appearing in similar contexts share similar meanings. Consequently, words located closely in a text are assumed to be highly similar, whereas words that are far apart are often dissimilar in meaning.

In CBOW, the probability $P$ of predicting the center word $c$ given surrounding context words $( w_1, w_2, \ldots , w_n)$ is calculated to maximize the likelihood of the center word appearing in the context. This is formally represented as:
 
$$
P(c | w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n) = P(c|w_1) \times P(c|w_2) \times \ldots \times P(c|w_n)
$$

where $P(c|w_i)$ represents the conditional probability of the center word given each individual context word $w_i$. The model is trained by adjusting weights to maximize this probability, leading to an embedding space that captures semantic relationships based on co-occurrence.

In a mathematical sense, the CBOW objective is to maximize the overall probability for the corpus. Given a hyper-parameter $\theta$ (which represents model parameters), the objective function is:

$$
\text{obj} = \arg \max_\theta \sum_{w \in \text{text}} \sum_{c \in \text{context}(w)} P(c|w; \theta)
$$

By training on these conditional probabilities, CBOW creates dense vector embeddings that reflect semantic similarities between words based on their contexts.


### Skip-Gram

The Skip-Gram model, an alternative to CBOW, is designed to predict the surrounding context words based on a given center word. This approach aims to maximize the probability of observing neighboring words, given a target word. Formally, the Skip-Gram model seeks to maximize the following objective function:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{-c \le j \le c, j \ne 0} \log P(w_{t+j} | w_t)
$$

Here:
- $T$ is the total number of words in the corpus.
- $c$ denotes the window size, representing how many context words around the target word are considered.
- $P(w_{t+j} | w_t)$ is the conditional probability of a context word $w_{t+j}$ given the center word $w_t$.

In Skip-Gram, this conditional probability $P(w_{t+j} | w_t)$ is typically computed using a Softmax function, which helps assign higher probabilities to context words that appear frequently with the center word. The formula for this probability is:

$$
P(w_o | w_I) = \frac{\exp(v_{w_o}^T v_{w_I})}{\sum_{w=1}^W \exp(v_w^T v_{w_I})}
$$

where:
- $v_{w_o}$ and $v_{w_I}$ are the vector embeddings of the output (context) word $w_o$ and input (center) word $w_I$, respectively.
- $W$ is the total vocabulary size.

**Window Size Impact**: The parameter $c$, which controls the context window size, affects both accuracy and training time. Larger windows tend to capture broader context but increase computation time, as each word is paired with more context words for training.

In the context of playlist modeling, the Skip-Gram approach can be adapted by treating each song as a "word" and each playlist as a "sentence." However, unlike natural language, where the order of words conveys meaning, playlists do not always rely on the sequence of songs. Instead, Skip-Gram might capture valuable associations by treating all songs within a playlist as contextually related, without assuming that specific songs need to appear close to each other to share relevance.
### CBOW (Continuous-Bag-of-Songs)
Simpler more elegant way of calculating the embeddings - secret by now


### Conclusion / work in progress
CBOW is better for Datasets with many fequent occuring words. Skip-Gram is better with many less frequent words ([Concluded here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2634/1/012052/meta)). Still need to test what algorithm performes better or is it the case to create an own algorithm for embedding songs inside playlists.  Both algorithms work with some kind of context window to understand the focused word. This type of window looking should not apply to playlists because there is the whole list relevant.

## ideas
CBOW will be the main focuse here at 

Cleaning up the dataset for outliers to polish the accuracy of the trained model

It's possible that I need to implement my own model for embedding those words of the playlist to let the context window slip.

For CBOS to work i need to convert the algorithm to real c code and also optimize the operations.
--> Tried training it with the full dataset (~1GB) after 1593min of training i needed to cancel it
    --> starting with basic optimization and also possible to convert it all to c
    --> rought calculation said the training should take about 1200min...
    --> possible to throw it on some cluster idk
