# b25
The goal of this repo to create an embedding model for song.mp3 files. 

The vector will represent the "vibe" of the song. 

# models
b25-sn-v50: song name - Vector Dim 50




## ideas
could also take a dataset of playlist
with songs in it and embedding them like the "sentences" to get the style of the individual songs. Would be one step in the direction of understanding the songs.

Could scramble the playlist to let the model understand what the songs mean and that the words in the specifc order are not important.  


Following step would be to get the embedding algorithms working with mp3 data.
