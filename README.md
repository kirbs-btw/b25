## General 
Training a standard word embedding model involves exposing it to a large corpus of sentences, allowing it to learn the semantic relationships between words by analyzing how they co-occur within sentence structures. This process relies on the distributional hypothesis, which suggests that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.

The approach in question extends this concept by drawing an analogy between sentences as collections of words and playlists as collections of songs. To construct a model for playlists, one could initially consider the song titles as the equivalent of words and the playlists as analogous to sentences. However, this direct mapping poses challenges when utilizing algorithms designed for natural language processing.

Many word embedding algorithms, such as Word2Vec, focus on local context windowsâ€”capturing the relationships between a word and its immediate neighbors. This assumption of locality doesn't directly translate to playlists, where the relationship between songs isn't necessarily dependent on their proximity or order within the playlist. Hence, adapting such algorithms for playlist modeling requires addressing the contextual difference between word co-occurrence and song co-inclusion in playlists. 

## Models
### Text embedding Models
These models are able to create vectors out of song names.

- b25-sn-v50: song name - Vector dim 50

- b25-sn-v256: song name - Vector dim 256

## Model Validation


## learning algorithms
### CBOW (Continuous-bag-of-words)

### Skip-Gram

### Conclusion / work in progress
CBOW is better for Datasets with many fequent occuring words. Skip-Gram is better with many less frequent words ([Concluded here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2634/1/012052/meta)). Still need to test what algorithm performes better or is it the case to create an own algorithm for embedding songs inside playlists.  Both algorithms work with some kind of context window to understand the focused word. This type of window looking should not apply to playlists because there is the whole list relevant.

## ideas
could also take a dataset of playlist
with songs in it and embedding them like the "sentences" to get the style of the individual songs. Would be one step in the direction of understanding the songs.

Could scramble the playlist to let the model understand what the songs mean and that the words in the specifc order are not important.  

CBOW will be the main focuse here at 

It's possible that I need to implement my own model for embedding those words of the playlist to let the context window slip.

Following step would be to get the embedding algorithms working with mp3 data.
